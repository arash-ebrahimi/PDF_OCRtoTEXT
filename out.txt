A Comprehen 2 Review of Published GRE® Validity Data

The Graduate Record Examinations® (GRE®) General Test measures skills that faculty and graduate deans have
consistently said are essential to graduate school success. These skills of verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning,
and critical thinking and analytical writing are foundational skills for applicants to a U.S. graduate program,
regardless of educational or linguistic background or country of origin.

Although the GRE Program has many studies of the predictive validity of the GRE General Test (which are available
on the GRE website: www.ets.org/gre), a recent meta-analysis by non-ETS researchers Nathan Kuncel, Sarah
Hezlett and Deniz Ones provides additional positive evidence of the relationship of the GRE General Test to various
criteria of graduate school success.' This meta-analysis is important because predictive validity studies are often
difficult to conduct for a variety of reasons (e.g., insufficient data, test scores or predictors of success that do not
vary greatly across examinees). Compared with earlier research, the Kuncel et
al. meta-analysis improved on these studies by examining the validity

RESEARCH

One strength of the Kuncel et al. research is that the
meta-analysis analyzed data from a very large data
set involving more than 1,753 independent samples
based on a pool of more than 80,000 students.
In addition, the study looked at five predictors of
success and eight criteria for success. The predictors
included the three measures of the GRE General Test
(verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning and analytical
reasoning), GRE Subject Test scores and undergraduate
grade point average (UGPA). The criteria for success are
shown in the figure to the left.

Results of the Kuncel et al. study

Results from this study show that:

1. The GRE General Test is a “generalizably valid predictor of first-year graduate GPA, overall graduate GPA,
comprehensive exam scores, publication citation counts and faculty ratings.”

2. The GRE General Test also correlates positively with degree attainment and research productivity.

3. The GRE General Test has better predictive validity than undergraduate grades or letters of recommendation.

4. The GRE Subject Tests are better predictors of success than either the GRE General Test or undergraduate GPA.

This meta-analysis study is important because these results apply across a range of intended academic majors,
across native speakers of English and nonnative speakers of English, across traditional and nontraditional students
and across master’s and doctoral programs.”

Validity of the Analytical Writing Measure

Because the Kuncel et a/. meta-analysis was conducted before the Analytical Writing (AW) measure was
introduced into the GRE General Test, it may be useful to include validity information for this measure. The two
tasks that comprise the AW are both considered essential in many fields of graduate study. These two tasks are
complementary in that the first requires the writer to construct his/her own argument about an issue, and the
second requires a critique of someone else's argument by assessing its claims. For virtually all disciplines, AW adds
value to the GRE General Test because it provides unique information about test-taker abilities over and above
skills measured in the Verbal and Quantitative measures.

Demonstrating the construct validity of the writing measure can be done by showing how AW correlates with other
measures it is intended to resemble. As an illustration, AW correlates positively with other samples of academic
writing produced by examinees* as shown in the figure below. Examinees in this study were asked to provide two
writing samples: one representing their typical written work and one not quite as well written.

This graph shows that there is
a strong positive relationship
between the GRE essay scores
and both of the writing samples Relationship Between Mean GRE Writing Assessment Scores and Mean
from examinees. It should be Undergraduate Course-Related Writing Sample

noted that the AW correlates
with these other indicators of
writing skill more closely than
does the personal statement
that many students submit with
their applications.’

Figure 2.

Furthermore, data indicate that
AW has a low correlation (.21)
with the quantitative measure and
a moderate correlation (.60) with
the verbal measure — a finding
that is consistent with the structure
and intent of those measures.°
Thus, AW is providing unique

and valuable information beyond GRE Essay Score Level

Summary

Because faculty want to make the best possible admissions decisions about graduate school applicants, it is
important to look objectively at the predictive value of the GRE General Test. The Kuncel et a/. study used all
existing data to arrive at the study's conclusions that the GRE General Test is a valid predictor of many criteria of
graduate school success. In addition, other research has demonstrated that the Analytical Writing section of the GRE
General Test can provide valuable information about applicants’ abilities to produce analytical essays. For these
reasons, the GRE General Test is a valuable asset in the graduate admissions process.
